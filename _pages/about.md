I am a Ph.D. candidate in Urban Planning at the University of Washington, concurrently pursuing an M.S. in Statistics. I began my academic journey at Wuhan University, where I earned a B.Eng. degree in Earth and Geographic Information Science. Subsequently, I obtained a Master's degree in Land Economics and Resources Management from Wuhan University and served as a research assistant at the <a href='https://sites.utexas.edu/uil/'>UT Urban Information Lab</a>. If you would like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me at mmcai@uw.edu.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
